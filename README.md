#### Sleepovers lets you spend the night with close friends. ðŸŒ™ But only if they are okay with it.

#### If a compatible NPC is sleeping, activate them to ask about spending the night. Your friendship with the NPC will play a large role in their response, and if they say no, you won't be able to bring it up again until the next day.

#### Pestering NPCs you don't know that well about it might have a negative effect on your relationship, while actually having sleepovers with good friends will likely improve your relationship with them even further.
